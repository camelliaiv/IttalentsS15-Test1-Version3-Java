# Ittalents, Test 1, Version 3, Java

Task №1: Write a program that reads two String values separated by space – each one – the value of a dice. Dices are called angle dice and shape dice. Possible inputs for the angle dice are “three”,”four”, ”five” and six”. Possible inputs for the shape dice are “triangle”, “square”, “pentagon” and “hexagon”. The inputs are infinite. The pro- gram must stop when there have been 3 consecutive throws of matching dices. A maching pair of dices means that the first dice` value describes the number of angles in the second dice`value. Finally, the program must ouput the total number of throws as well sa the total number of angles that had been seen from the first dice.

Task №2: Write a function that takes a 2 String variables that hold some text. The pro- gram must output all the words that appear in the first text but not in the second one. The words are separated only with space.

Task №3: Write a method that by a given int number and another int x returns if the number has exactly x dividers (one and self excluded). Use Recursion!

Task №4: Write a method that takes a 2D array of characters and an array of words. The method has to check if each word from the second array is contained in a row or in a column of the first array. Words may be contained only in part of the row or column. The method must return true if all words are contained in the 2D array. False other-wise.
